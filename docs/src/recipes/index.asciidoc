Recipes
=======

image:gremlin-chef.png[width=120,float=left] All programming languages tend to have
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern[patterns of usage] for commonly occurring problems. Gremlin
is not different in that respect. There are many commonly occurring traversal themes that have general applicability
to any graph. Gremlin Recipes present these common traversal patterns and methods of usage that will
provide some basic building blocks for virtually any graph in any domain.

Recipes assume general familiarity with Gremlin and the TinkerPop stack. Be sure to have read the
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/tutorials/getting-started[Getting Started] tutorial and the
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/tutorials/the-gremlin-console/[The Gremlin Console] tutorial.
