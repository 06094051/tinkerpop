image:egg-logo.png[width=200,float=left] link:http://incubator.apache.org/projects/tinkerpop.html[Apache TinkerPop] is an effort undergoing incubation at link:http://apache.org[The Apache Software Foundation] (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF. Apache TinkerPop is distributed under the Apache License v2.0.
