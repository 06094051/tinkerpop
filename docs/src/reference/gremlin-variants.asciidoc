Gremlin Variants
================

Gremlin is a graph traversal language that makes use of two fundamental programming constructs:
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition[function composition] and
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_function[function nesting]. Given this generality, it is possible to embed
Gremlin any modern programming language. Gremlin is a "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism[Plantoic concept]"
with two *variants* that are distributed by Apache TinkerPop that can be used on the Java Virtual Machine: Gremlin-Java and
Gremlin-Groovy. Apache TinkerPop also distributed Gremlin-Python for use with either the JVM (Jython) or CPython.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Java is the canonical representation of Gremlin and any (proper) Gremlin language variant will emulate its
constructs as best as possible given the constructs of the host language. This ensures that the general Gremlin reference
documentation is applicable to other languages variants.

NOTE: The information in this section only provides information on how to use the Gremlin language variants distributed
with Apache TinkerPop. For information on how to build a Gremlin language variant,
please review the link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlin-language-variants/[Gremlin Language Variants]
tutorial.

[[gremlin-python]]
Gremlin-Python
--------------

Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Python represents Gremlin within the link:https://www.python.org/[Python] language and can be used on any Python virtual machine
including the popular link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython[CPython] machine.

[source,bash]
pip install requests
pip install gremlin_python
pip install gremlin_driver
pip install gremlin_rest_driver

There are three primary classes distributed with Gremlin-Python: `PythonGraphTraversalSource`, `PythonGraphTraversal`, and `__`.

[source,python]
from gremlin_python import PythonGraphTraversalSource
from gremlin_python import PythonGraphTraversal
from gremlin_python import __
from gremlin_rest_driver import RESTRemoteConnection

These classes mirror `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__`, respectively in Gremlin-Java. The `PythonGraphTraversalSource`
requires a driver in order to communicate with <<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>> (or any <<connecting-via-remotegraph,`RemoteConnection`>>-enabled server).
The `gremlin_rest_driver` is provided with Apache TinkerPop and it serves as a simple (though verbose) driver that sends traversals to GremlinServer
via HTTP POST (using link:http://docs.python-requests.org/[requests]) and in return, is provided <<graphson-reader-writer,GraphSON>>-encoded results.
When GremlinServer is running, Gremlin-Python can communicate with GremlinServer.

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/gremlin-server.sh conf/gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml
[INFO] GremlinServer -
       \,,,/

[INFO] GremlinServer$1 - Channel started at port 8182.
----

Within CPython, its possible to evaluate the following.

[source,python]
conn = RESTRemoteConnection('http://localhost:8182','gremlin-groovy')
g = PythonGraphTraversalSource("g",conn)
g.V().repeat(__.out()).times(2).name.toList()

CAUTION: Python has `as`, `in`, `and`, `or`, `is`, `not`, `from`, and `global` as reserved words. Gremlin-Python simply
prefixes `_` in front of these terms for their use with graph traversal. For instance: `g.V()._as('a')._in()._as('b').select('a','b')`.

Statics Tokens and Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `T`, `P`, `Order`, `Operator`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin-Python.

[source,python]
from gremlin_python import T
from gremlin_python import Order
from gremlin_python import Column
from gremlin_python import Operator
from gremlin_python import P

These can be used analagously to how they are used in Gremlin-Java.

[source,python]
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',P.gt(30)).order().by('age',Order.decr)

Moreover, by importing the `statics` of Gremlin-Python, the class prefixes can be removed.

[source,python]
from gremlin_python import statics
for k in statics:
  globals()[k] = statics[k]

With statics, loaded its possible to represent the above traversal as below.

[source,python]
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',gt(30)).order().by('age',decr)

Moreover, statics includes all the `__`-methods and thus, anonymous traversals like `__.out()` can be expressed as below.

[source,python]
g.V().repeat(out()).times(2).name.toList()

Gremlin-Python Sugar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python supports meta-programming and operator overloading. There are three uses of these techniques in Gremlin-Python that
makes traversals a bit more succinct.

[source,python]
g.V().both()[1:3]
g.V().both()[1]
g.V().both().name
