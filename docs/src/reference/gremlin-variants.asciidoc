Gremlin Variants
================

Gremlin is a graph traversal language that makes use of two fundamental programming constructs:
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition[function composition] and
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_function[function nesting]. Given this generality, it is possible to embed
Gremlin any modern programming language. Gremlin is a "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism[Plantoic concept]"
with two *variants* that are distributed by Apache TinkerPop that can be used on the Java Virtual Machine: Gremlin-Java and
Gremlin-Groovy. Apache TinkerPop also distributed Gremlin-Python for use with either the JVM (Jython) or CPython.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Java is the canonical representation of Gremlin and any (proper) Gremlin language variant will emulate its
structure as best as possible given the constructs of the host language. A strong correspondence between variants ensures
that the general Gremlin reference documentation is applicable to all variants and that users moving between development
languages can easily adopt the Gremlin language variant for that language.

NOTE: The information in this section only provides information on how to use the Gremlin language variants distributed
with Apache TinkerPop. For information on how to build a Gremlin language variant,
please review the link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlin-language-variants/[Gremlin Language Variants]
tutorial.

Gremlin-Python
--------------

image:gremlin-python-drawing.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Python implements Gremlin within
the link:https://www.python.org/[Python] language and can be used on any Python virtual machine including the popular
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython[CPython] machine. Python's syntax has the same constructs as Java including
"dot notation" for function chaining (`a.b.c`), round bracket function arguments (`a(b,c)`), and support for global
namespaces (`a(b())` vs `a(__.b())`). As such, anyone familiar with Gremlin-Java will immediately be able to work
with Gremlin-Python. Moreover, there are a few added constructs to Gremlin-Python that make traversals a bit more succinct.

To install Gremlin-Python, simply use Python's link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)[pip] package manager.

[source,bash]
pip install requests
pip install gremlin_python
pip install gremlin_driver
pip install gremlin_rest_driver

There are three primary classes distributed with Gremlin-Python: `PythonGraphTraversalSource`, `PythonGraphTraversal`, and `__`.

[source,python]
from gremlin_python import PythonGraphTraversalSource
from gremlin_python import PythonGraphTraversal
from gremlin_python import __
from gremlin_rest_driver import RESTRemoteConnection

These classes mirror `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__`, respectively in Gremlin-Java. The `PythonGraphTraversalSource`
requires a driver in order to communicate with <<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>> (or any <<connecting-via-remotegraph,`RemoteConnection`>>-enabled server).
The `gremlin_rest_driver` is provided with Apache TinkerPop and it serves as a simple (though verbose) driver that sends traversals to GremlinServer
via HTTP POST (using link:http://docs.python-requests.org/[requests]) and in return, is provided <<graphson-reader-writer,GraphSON>>-encoded results.
`RESTRemoteConnection` extends the abstract class `RemoteConnection` in `gremlin_driver`.

NOTE: For developers wishing to provide another *driver implementation* (e.g. one using the more efficient
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket[WebSockets] protocol), be sure to extend `RemoteConnection` in `gremlin_driver` so it
can then be used by `PythonGraphTraversal`.

When GremlinServer is running, Gremlin-Python can communicate with GremlinServer. The `conf/gremlin-server-rest.modern.yaml`
configuration is used to expose GremlinServer's REST interface.

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/gremlin-server.sh conf/gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml
[INFO] GremlinServer -
       \,,,/
       (o o)
---oOOo-(3)-oOOo---

[INFO] GremlinServer - Configuring Gremlin Server from conf/gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml
[INFO] GraphManager - Graph [graph] was successfully configured via [conf/tinkergraph-empty.properties].
[INFO] ScriptEngines - Loaded gremlin-groovy ScriptEngine
[INFO] GremlinExecutor - Initialized gremlin-groovy ScriptEngine with scripts/generate-modern.groovy
[INFO] ServerGremlinExecutor - A GraphTraversalSource is now bound to [g] with graphtraversalsource[tinkergraph[vertices:0 edges:0], standard]
[INFO] AbstractChannelizer - Configured application/json with org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.ser.GraphSONMessageSerializerV1d0
[INFO] GremlinServer$1 - Channel started at port 8182.
----

Within the CPython console, it is possible to evaluate the following.

[source,python]
conn = RESTRemoteConnection('http://localhost:8182')
g = PythonGraphTraversalSource(GroovyTranslator('g'), conn)
g.V().repeat(__.out()).times(2).name.toList()

CAUTION: Python has `as`, `in`, `and`, `or`, `is`, `not`, `from`, and `global` as reserved words. Gremlin-Python simply
prefixes `_` in front of these terms for their use with graph traversal. For instance: `g.V()._as('a')._in()._as('b').select('a','b')`.

`GroovyTranslator` extends `Translator` and serves as a simple machine that translates Gremlin-Python to Gremlin-Groovy for ultimate
evaluation on `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine` on GremlinServer. It is possible to write other translators to be used with other
`ScriptEngines` on GremlinServer (or any other `RemoteConnection`-based endpoint).

NOTE: For developers wishing to provide their own *translator implementation* (e.g. one using Jython), be sure to extend
`Translator` in `gremlin_python` so it can be used by `PythonGraphTraversal`.

Static Enums and Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `T`, `P`, `Order`, `Operator`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin-Python as Python `Enums`.

[source,python]
from gremlin_python import T
from gremlin_python import Order
from gremlin_python import Cardinality
from gremlin_python import Column
from gremlin_python import Direction
from gremlin_python import Operator
from gremlin_python import P
from gremlin_python import Pop
from gremlin_python import Scope
from gremlin_python import Barrier

These can be used analogously to how they are used in Gremlin-Java.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',P.gt(30)).order().by('age',Order.decr)
----

Moreover, by importing the `statics` of Gremlin-Python, the class prefixes can be removed.

[source,python]
from gremlin_python import statics
for k in statics:
  globals()[k] = statics[k]

With statics loaded its possible to represent the above traversal as below.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',gt(30)).order().by('age',decr)
----

Finally, statics includes all the `__`-methods and thus, anonymous traversals like `__.out()` can be expressed as below.
That is, without the `__.`-prefix.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().repeat(out()).times(2).name.fold()
----

Gremlin-Python Sugar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python supports meta-programming and operator overloading. There are three uses of these techniques in Gremlin-Python that
makes traversals a bit more concise.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().both()[1:3]
g.V().both()[1]
g.V().both().name
----

The Lambda Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supporting link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[anonymous functions] across languages is extremely difficult at best.
As a simple solution, it is up to the `Translator` (not Gremlin-Python) to decide how
link:https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#lambda[Python lambdas] should be treated. For `GroovyTranslator`,
a Python lambda should be a zero-arg callable that returns a string representation of a Groovy closure.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().out().map(lambda: "it.get().value('name').length()").sum()
----

Note that with a `JythonTranslator` (currently not available through Apache TinkerPop), it is possible to introspect on
the source code of a Python lambda and use that during translation. An example of how that would be achieved is provided
below.

[source,python]
>>> from dill.source import getsource
>>> getsource(lambda traverser: len(traverser.get().values('name')))
"lambda traverser: len(traverser.get().values('name'))\n"

The important point is that the "lambda solution" is not universal and each `Translator` will specify have lambdas should be
written in the lost language in order to be used effectively in the translated/execution language.

RawExpressions in Gremlin-Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `RawExpression` allows users to leverage APIs offered by the graph system provider and host languages that are
not part of the standard Gremlin language. The `RawExpression` constructor takes string and 2-tuple bindings that are
ultimately concatenated together by the `Translator`. Like lambdas, `RawExpressions` are tied to the underlying
translator and now the host language and thus, a `RawExpression` used for Gremlin-Groovy execution may not work
for Gremlin-Jython.

The following example uses `RawExpression` to call the `Geoshape.point` static constructor method on the `Geoshape`
class provided by Aurelius' link:http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/[Titan] graph database.

[source,python]
----
g.V().has('location', RawExpression('Geoshape.point(', ('x', 45), ', ', ('y', -45), ')'))
----

Note that both `x` and `y` are `RemoteConnection` bindings with values 45 and -45 respectively.

To help readability, especially if an expression will be used more than once, it is recommended that a helper class be
created. Again, note that this helper class is tied to GroovyTranslator as its `point()` `RawExpression` return is
tied to the the underlying execution language.

[source,python]
----
class Geoshape(object):
    @staticmethod
    def point(latitude, longitude):
        return RawExpression('Geoshape.point(', latitude, ', ', longitude, ')')
----

The previous traversal can now be written simply as below.

[source,python]
----
g.V().has('location', Geoshape.point(('x', 45), ('y', -45)))
----

Or, without using bindings:

[source,python]
----
g.V().has('location', Geoshape.point(45,-45))
----
