Upgrading for Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gremlin Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transaction.close() Default Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default behavior of `Transaction.close()` is to rollback the transaction.  This is in contrast to previous versions
where the default behavior was commit.  Using rollback as the default should be thought of as a like a safer approach
to closing where a user must now explicitly call `commit()` to persist their mutations.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-805[TINKERPOP3-805] for more information.

Upgrading for Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graph System Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transaction.close() Default Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default behavior for `Transaction.close()` is to rollback the transaction and is enforced by tests, which
previously asserted the opposite (i.e. commit on close).  These tests have been renamed to suite the new semantics:

* `shouldCommitOnCloseByDefault` became `shouldCommitOnCloseWhenConfigured`
* `shouldRollbackOnCloseWhenConfigured` became `shouldRollbackOnCloseByDefault`

If these tests were referenced in an `OptOut`, then their names should be updated.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-805[TINKERPOP3-805] for more information.
