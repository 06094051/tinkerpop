===============

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/master/docs/static/images/gremlin-gangster.png[width=225]

*A 187 On The Undercover Gremlinz*

TinkerPop 3.1.0
---------------

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Additional upgrade information can be found here:

* <<_tinkerpop_3_0_2,TinkerPop 3.0.2>>
* <<_tinkerpop_3_0_1,TinkerPop 3.0.1>>

Important Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Gephi Plugin has improved integration with Gephi, where manually inserting {{store}} steps to visualize a running traversal is no longer required.
* Entire TinkerGraph instances can be serialized over Gryo.
* Hadoop1 support has been dropped. Hadoop2 is now supported. Giraph 1.1.0 is now supported and Spark of Hadoop2 YARN.
* The implementation and semantics of `GraphTraversal.group()` has changed. The previous model is deprecated and renamed to `groupV3d0()`.

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/blob/3.1.0-incubating/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX[changelog] for a complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

Upgrading for Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gremlin Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transaction.close() Default Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default behavior of `Transaction.close()` is to rollback the transaction.  This is in contrast to previous versions
where the default behavior was commit.  Using rollback as the default should be thought of as a like a safer approach
to closing where a user must now explicitly call `commit()` to persist their mutations.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-805[TINKERPOP3-805] for more information.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Transaction.onReadWrite() and Transaction.onClose() are now `ThreadLocal` settings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `Transaction.onReadWrite()` and `Transaction.onClose()` settings now need to be set for each thread (if another behavior than the default is desired).
For gremlin-server users that may be changing these settings via scripts :
If the settings are changed from a sessionless request they will now only apply to that one request.
If the settings are changed from an in-session request they will now only apply to all future requests made in the scope of that session. 

=======
Gremlin Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graph Traversal Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* `ConjunctionStrategy` has been renamed to `ConnectiveStrategy` (no other behaviors changed).
* `ConjunctionP` has been renamed to `ConnectiveP` (no other behaviors changed).
* `DedupBijectionStrategy` has been renamed (and made more effective) as `FilterRankingStrategy`.
* The `GraphTraversal` mutation API has change significantly with all previous methods being supported but deprecated.
** The general pattern used now is `addE('knows').from(select('a')).to(select('b')).property('weight',1.0)`.
* The `GraphTraversal` sack API has changed with all previous methods being supported but deprecated.
** The old `sack(mult,'weight')` is now `sack(mult).by('weight')`.
* `GroupStep` has been redesigned such that there is now only a key- and value-traversal. No more reduce-traversal.
** The previous `group()`-methods have been renamed to `groupV3d0()`. To immediately upgrade, rename all your `group()`-calls to `groupV3d0()`.
** To migrate to the new `group()`-methods, what was `group().by('age').by(outE()).by(sum(local))` is now `group().by('age').by(outE().sum())`.
* There was a bug in `fold()`, where if a bulked traverser was provided, the traverser was only represented once.
** This bug fix might cause a breaking change to a user query if the non-bulk behavior was being counted on. If so, used `dedup()` prior to `fold()`.
* Both `GraphTraversal().mapKeys()` and `GraphTraversal.mapValues()` has been deprecated.
** Use `select(keys)` and `select(columns)`. However, note that `select()` will not unroll the keys/values. Thus, `mapKeys()` => `select(keys).unfold()`.

Gremlin-Groovy Updates
++++++++++++++++++++++

* The closure wrappers classes `GFunction`, `GSupplier`, `GConsumer` have been deprecated.
** In Groovy, a closure can be specified using `as Function` and thus, these wrappers are not needed.

Hadoop-Gremlin Updates
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Hadoop1 is no longer supported. Hadoop2 is now the only supported Hadoop version in TinkerPop.
* The directory where application jars are stored in HDFS is now `hadoop-gremlin-x.y.z-libs`.
** This versioning is important so that cross-version TinkerPop use does not cause jar conflicts.

Upgrading for Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graph System Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transaction.close() Default Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default behavior for `Transaction.close()` is to rollback the transaction and is enforced by tests, which
previously asserted the opposite (i.e. commit on close).  These tests have been renamed to suite the new semantics:

* `shouldCommitOnCloseByDefault` became `shouldCommitOnCloseWhenConfigured`
* `shouldRollbackOnCloseWhenConfigured` became `shouldRollbackOnCloseByDefault`

If these tests were referenced in an `OptOut`, then their names should be updated.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-805[TINKERPOP3-805] for more information.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Driver Implementers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transaction.onReadWrite() and Transaction.onClose() are now `ThreadLocal` settings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your driver configures the `Transaction.onReadWrite()` or `Transaction.onClose()` settings, note that these no longer apply to all future requests. 
If the settings are changed from a sessionless request they will only apply to that one request.
If the settings are changed from an in-session request they will only apply to all future requests made in the scope of that session. 
=======
Graph Traversal Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++++

There were numerous changes to the `GraphTraversal` API. Nearly all changes are backwards compatible with respective "deprecated" annotations. Please review the respective updates specified in the "Graph System Users" section.
