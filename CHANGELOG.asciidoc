TinkerPop 3.0.0.M2 (Release Date: NOT RELEASED)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add `@OptIn` and `@OptOut` for implementers to specify on their `Graph` implementations for test compliance information.
* `GraphComputer` `SideEffects` now immutable after computation is complete.
* Dependency grabbing for plugins filter out slf4j logging dependencies so as to avoid multiple bindings with the standard TinkerPop distributions.
* Fixed Giraph-Gremlin sideEffects to be fully consistent with GraphComputer specification.
* Removed fatJar assembly from Giraph-Graph as it is no longed needed with distributed cache model.
* Reworked `GiraphRemoteAcceptor` to provide a `result` variable back to the console with `ComputerResult`.
* `VertexProgram` is not longer `Serializable` (use `loadState` and `storeState` for wire-propagation).
* Moved `GiraphGraph.getOutputGraph()` to `GiraphHelper`.
* Changed `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_HOME` to `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_LIB` to reference directory where jars are to be loaded.
* Updated README with release instructions.
