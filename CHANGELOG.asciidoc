TinkerPop 3.0.0.M2 (Release Date: NOT RELEASED)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `TreeStep` now has `TreeMapReduce` for executing on `GraphComputer`.
* `Neo4jTraversal.cypher()` is fluent throughout.
* Reverted back to TP2 model of `as()` referring to step names, not variable names of sideEffects.
* Updated `AddEdge`-step to support property key/value pairs for appending to newly created edges.
* Renamed `Graph.getFeatures()` to `Graph.features()` to be consistent with other API methods.
* `Vertex` and `Edge` now implement all `GraphTraversal` methods to ensure consistency throughout stack.
* `Neo4jTraversal` is auto-generated from `Neo4jTraversalStub` with technique generalizable to other vendors.
* Added test suite to ensure that all traversals are of the same type: g.V, g.E, g.of(), v.identity(), e.identity(), v-, e-methods.
* Giraph HDFS helpers now support `hdfs.mkdir(string)` and `local.mkdir(string)`
* Added `@OptIn` and `@OptOut` for implementers to specify on their `Graph` implementations for test compliance information.
* `GraphComputer` `SideEffects` now immutable after computation is complete.
* Dependency grabbing for plugins filter out slf4j logging dependencies so as to avoid multiple bindings with the standard TinkerPop distributions.
* Fixed Giraph-Gremlin sideEffects to be fully consistent with GraphComputer specification.
* Removed fatJar assembly from Giraph-Graph as it is no longed needed with distributed cache model.
* Reworked `GiraphRemoteAcceptor` to provide a `result` variable back to the console with `ComputerResult`.
* `VertexProgram` is not longer `Serializable` (use `loadState` and `storeState` for wire-propagation).
* Moved `GiraphGraph.getOutputGraph()` to `GiraphHelper`.
* Changed `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_HOME` to `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_LIB` to reference directory where jars are to be loaded.
* Updated README with release instructions.
